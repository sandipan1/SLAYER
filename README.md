# SLAYER
Autonomous line following robot
Objective: To build an autonomous robot which can move from one point to another in a room

Components Required: 

Raspberry Pi
Motors
Wifi Module
Li-Po Batteries
Battery Bank
Wi-Fi Module
Connecting Wires
Wheels
Encoders
Motor Driver
Line-Array Sensors
Proximity Sensor

Description (Some Insights):
*Proportional–Integral–Derivative Controller (PID Controller) to be used as a control loop feedback mechanism
*Dijkstra’s Algorithm to be used to find the shortest possible path
*Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm (modified) to be used for navigation and mapping.
*The virtual map created, will be stored in an adjacency matrix or list.
*Works on the principle of line follower bot, an array of IR Sensors to be used to scan the nearby environment and 
  map a graph for smooth transportation.
